"""Rank-dependent verification payloads for DLcomm.

Rationale
---------
The original benchmark filled every input buffer with ``torch.ones()``. For every
non-SUM reduction and every data-movement collective the expected output of an
all-ones input is *also* all-ones, so a collective that moved no data at all
still passed verification. See ``docs/fixes/01-rank-dependent-verification.md``.

This module builds payloads whose value depends on **which rank** produced them
and on **which element position** within the buffer, so that:

  * a no-op / dropped transfer is detected (values differ per rank),
  * a mis-ordered gather or all-to-all is detected (position matters),
  * a wrong-chunk reduce-scatter is detected (position matters).

Payload shape
-------------
For a rank at index ``i`` within its process group::

    x[idx] = rank_signature(i) + position_signature(idx)

``rank_signature`` is a small bounded integer (1..K) and ``position_signature``
is ``idx % Q``. Both are kept deliberately small so that reduction results stay
exactly representable in the benchmark's floating point dtypes: the largest
value any check has to represent is about ``group_size * (K + Q)``.

For PRODUCT reductions the signature is restricted to ``{1, 2}`` over a bounded
number of contributing ranks, because a product over thousands of ranks
overflows any supported dtype.
